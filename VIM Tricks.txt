Q:  How can I swap positions of two open files (in splits) in vim?
A:  Starting with this:
    
    ____________________
    | one       | two  |
    |           |      |
    |           |______|
    |           | three|
    |           |      |
    |___________|______|
    Make 'three' the active window, then issue the command ctrl-w J. This moves the current window to fill the bottom of the screen, leaving you with:
    
    ____________________
    | one       | two  |
    |           |      |
    |___________|______|
    | three            |
    |                  |
    |__________________|
    Now make either 'one' or 'two' the active window, then issue the command ctrl-w r. This 'rotates' the windows in the current row, leaving you with:
    
    ____________________
    | two       | one  |
    |           |      |
    |___________|______|
    | three            |
    |                  |
    |__________________|
    Now make 'two' the active window, and issue the command ctrl-w H. This moves the current window to fill the left of the screen, leaving you with:
    
    ____________________
    | two       | one  |
    |           |      |
    |           |______|
    |           | three|
    |           |      |
    |___________|______|
    As you can see, the manouevre is a bit of a shuffle. With 3 windows, it's a bit like one of those 'tile game' puzzles. I don't recommand trying this if you have 4 or more windows - you'd be better off closing them then opening them again in the desired positions.
    
    I made a screencast demonstrating how to work with split windows in Vim.
